# msvc8.0

This repository contains a portable version of the MSVC 8.0 x86 toolchain, inspired by [itsmattkc/MSVC420](https://github.com/itsmattkc/MSVC420). All files were extracted from the [Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition installation media](https://archive.org/details/en_vs_2005_pro_dvd_202207). The root directory of the repository contains files extracted from the `VC` directory of the installation media, with non-x86 files removed. Additionally, the `mspdb*.*` files were extracted from the `Common7\IDE` directory of the installation media and added to the `bin` directory. Finally, the `bin/vcvars32.bat` file was modified to work with the portable toolchain.

To use the portable toolchain, simply clone the repository and run `bin/vcvars32.bat` from `cmd.exe`. This will add `bin` and `PlatformSDK\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable giving you access to `cl`, `link`, `lib`, and other tools. Also, `ATLMFC\INCLUDE`, `INCLUDE`, and `PlatformSDK\include` will be added to the `INCLUDE` environment variable. Finally, `ATLMFC\LIB`, `LIB`, and `PlatformSDK\lib` will be added to the `LIB` environment variable.
